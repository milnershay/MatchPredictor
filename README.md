# MatchPredictor
The Soccer Match Prediction App is a user-friendly application designed to predict the outcomes of soccer matches based on trained machine learning models. It provides an intuitive interface for users to select a match and a prediction model, and then generates a prediction for the match result.
## Features:
1.	Match Selection: Users can choose from a list of available soccer matches. The match options are dynamically generated based on the underlying dataset, providing up-to-date match selections.
2.	Model Selection: Users can select from a range of prediction models, including Decision Tree Classifier, Gradient Boosting Classifier, K-Nearest Neighbors Classifier, and Random Forest Classifier. Each model has been pre-trained on historical match data to make accurate predictions.
3.	Prediction Generation: Upon selecting a match and a model, the app generates a prediction for the match outcome. The prediction is displayed in the user interface, indicating whether it predicts a home win, away win, or a draw.
4.	Actual Result Comparison: The app also displays the actual result of the selected match, allowing users to compare the predicted outcome with the real outcome. This feature provides an opportunity to evaluate the accuracy of the prediction model.
## How to Use:
1.	Launch the Soccer Match Prediction App.
2.	Select a match from the available options.
3.	Choose a prediction model from the provided list.
4.	Click the "Predict" button to generate the prediction.
5.	View the predicted outcome and compare it with the actual result.
6.	Repeat the process to make predictions for different matches and models.
